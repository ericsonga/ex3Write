Posttest Write Code Problem
----------------------------
    
Finish writing the function ``getAverageRainfall`` that takes a list that contains the amount of rainfall for each day, collected by a meteorologist. Her rain gathering equipment occasionally makes a mistake and reports a negative amount for that day.  Calculate the total rainfall by adding up all the non-negative values (including 0), also count the number of non-negative values, and return the average rainfall at the end.  Only return the average if there was at least one non-negative integer in the list, otherwise return 0.

Examples
=========

For example ``getAverageRainfall([1, 2, -3, 3])`` should ignore the -3 and sum (1 + 2 + 3) which is 6 and then divide 6 by 3 (the number of values used in the sum) to return 2.  Also, the function ``getAverageRainfall([-1, -2, -1, -3])`` should return 0 since there are no non-negative numbers in the list.
