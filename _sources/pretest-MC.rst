      :correct: c
      :feedback_a: This answer would be true if the end value was 4 rather than 3.
      :feedback_b: This answer would be true if the start value was 0 rather than 1.
      :feedback_c: This would be true if it was looking for the largest value in the list from start to end (inclusive), but it finds the smallest value.
      :feedback_d: The range function returns a list from first to (last - 1) so this will look for the smallest value from index 1 to 3 and so return 3.  
      :feedback_e: This would be true if range returned a list of values from the first to last but it returns from first to last - 1.

      What does the following function return from mystery([2, 5, 8, 3, -1],1,3)?

      Consider the following code fragment.  What will it print when it executes?
      ::
               
           list1 = [1, 2, 4, 7]
           list2 = [1, 2, 5, 7]
           i1 = len(list1) - 1
           i2 = len(list2) - 1
           count = 0
           while i1 > 0 and i2 > 0:
           if list1[i1] == list2[i2]:
               count=count + 1
               i1 = i1 - 1
               i2 = i2 - 1
           elif list1[i1] < list2[i2]:
               i2 = i2 - 1
           else:
               i1 = i1 - 1

      :answer_c: 2
      :answer_d: 3
      :answer_e: 4
      :correct: a
      :feedback_a: While this loops through the indices from 1 to 3 it compares the index to the target and so count remains 0.
      :feedback_b: This would be true if it compared the value at the index to the target, but it compares the index to the target.
      :feedback_c: This would be true if the range included the last value and the code compared the value at the index to the target.
      :feedback_d: This would be true if the start value was 0 and the range included the last value, and the code compared the value at the index to the target.
      :feedback_e: This would be true if the start value was 0 and the end value was 6 and the code compared the value at the index to the target. 

      Given the following function definition, what would be returned from mystery(5, 1, 4, [5, 1, 5, 5, 5])?
      ::

          def mystery(target, start, end, numList):
              count = 0
              for index in range(start, end):
                  current = index
                  if current == target:
                      count = count + 1
              return count
          
   .. mchoice:: pre4
      :answer_a: a = 5 and b = -2
      :answer_b: a = 6 and b = 7
      :answer_c: a = 6 and b = 3 
      :answer_d: a = 12 and b = 1
      :answer_e: a = 5 and b = 8
      :correct: e
      :feedback_a: This would be true if you forget to update t and use an old value.
      :feedback_b: This would be true if you never update t.  
      :feedback_c: This happens when t is linked with a and students use a's value when updating b.
      :feedback_d: You do one extra loop. 
      :feedback_e: Good job tracing this! 

      What do ``a`` and ``b`` equal after the following code executes?
      ::

          a = 10
          b = 3
          t = 0
          for i in range(1,4):
              t = a
              a = i + b
              b = t - i

      :answer_c: 20.0
      :answer_d: 25.0
      :answer_e: 0
      :correct: d
      :feedback_a: This would be true if start was 0 and end was 1.
      :feedback_b: This would be true if start was 2 and end was 2.
      :feedback_c: This would be true if start was 0 and end was 3.  
      :feedback_d: This is 20 + 30 = 50 / 2 = 25.0.
      :feedback_e: This would be true if end was less than start.  

      Given the following code what will mystery([10,20,30],1,2) return?
      ::
      
          def mystery(numList, start, end):
              sum = 0
              for index in range(start,end+1):
                  value = numList[index]
                  sum = sum + value
              if (end - start + 1) >= 1:
                  return sum / (end - start + 1)
              return 0
